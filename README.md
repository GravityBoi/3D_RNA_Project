# Stanford RNA 3D Folding

This repository contains our work as part of the Stanford RNA 3D Folding Kaggle competition.

Authors: Max Neuwinger, Sarah Verreault, Andreas Hiropedi

## Folder structure

The repository contains the following folders:

- ```Analysis code```: this contains the notebooks we used to obtain insights about aspects of the data we were working with, as well as information about model confidence scores and model selection as a motivation for our meta learner
- ```DRfold2```: this contains all the notebooks we used to test the DRfold2 model (https://github.com/leeyang/DRfold2)
- ```Protenix```: this contains all the notebooks we used to test the Protenix model (https://github.com/bytedance/Protenix)
- ```RhoFold+```: this contains all the notebooks we used to test the RhoFold+ model (https://github.com/ml4bio/RhoFold)
- ```RibonanzaNet2```: this contains all the notebooks we used to test the RibonanzaNet2 model (https://www.kaggle.com/models/shujun717/ribonanzanet2)
- ```Ensembles```: this contains all our code used for our experiments with different model ensemble strategies
- ```Meta-learner```: this contains all our code used for our experiments with the meta learner
